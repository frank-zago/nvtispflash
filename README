A basic serial mode ISP programmer for Nuvoton N76E003, under Linux

This program is released under the GPL v2 or later license. See
COPYING.

Requirements
============

A Nuvoton N76E003 development board with UART pins, already programmed
with the Nuvoton LDROM that provides ISP programming. For instance,
that one:
  https://www.electrodragon.com/product/n76e003-mini-development-board/
A board without the ISP capability will need to be flashed with a
NU-Link device.

A PC with a serial port, or some USB-to-UART adapter, such as a CP2102
or WH340. Ideally this adapter is able to power the chip too.

Connection
==========

The ISP module will start if the chip sees a specific connect packet
on its serial port 0 within a few milliseconds after powering up. If
it doesn't get the packet, it will boot normally.

The steps to get it to boot in ISP mode are:

  - Connect the host and the board:
       GND <--> GND
       RX  <--> TX
       TX  <--> RX.
    Leave out 3.3V. On the board above, that would be the 4 pins on the
    top right, when the usb connector is on the left.

  - Connect the USB adapter.

  - Start nvtispflash, which will begin polling the chip through the
    serial device.

  - Connect the 3.3V line to power up the N76 chip. The device will
    recognize the connect command, and enter the ISP mode.

Usage
=====

ISP programmer for Nuvoton N76E003
Options:
  --serial-device, -d    serial device to use. Defaults to /dev/ttyUSB0
  --aprom, -a            binary APROM file to flash
  --remain-isp, -r       remain in ISP mode when exiting

iHEX files must be converted to binary first. SDCC provides the makebin
tool for that purpose:

    makebin -p prog.ihx prog.bin

The file will be flashed at offset 0, which is the start address of
the chip.

Flashing the whole 14Kb shouldn't take more than a few seconds.

Example
=======

    $ ./nvtispflash  -a blink.bin
    Ready to connect
    Connected
    FW version: 0x27
    Device is N76E003
    Config:
      LOCK: 1
      RPD: 0
      OCDEN: 0
      OCDPWM: 1
      CBS: 0
      LDSIZE: LDROM=4K, APROM=14K
      CBORST:1
      BOIAP:1
      CBOV:3
      CBODEN:1
      WDTEN:15
    Flashing APROM with blink.bin
    sending block of 48 bytes
    sending block of 56 bytes
    sending block of 56 bytes
    sending block of 56 bytes
    sending block of 20 bytes
    Done
    Rebooting to APROM

Caveats
=======

Only the N76E003 is supported although other Nuvoton chips could be.

There is no error recovery. If an error happens, the program will bail
out.

nvtispflash will not work on big-endian machines. Some byte swapping
work would be needed.

Programming the config or the data section is not supported at this
moment, but should not be difficult to add.
